4. **Faster Releases**: One-click release process with full validation
5. **Improved Collaboration**: Structured templates and auto-merge capabilities

## ðŸ“‹ Usage Quick Start

### Creating a Release
1. Go to **Actions** â†’ **Automated Release**
2. Click **"Run workflow"**

4. Choose pre-release options if needed
5. Click **"Run workflow"** - automation handles the rest!

### Managing Issues
- **New issues** are automatically labeled based on content
- **Comment** `/create-sub-issues "Title" "Body"` to create sub-issues
- **Add** `fixed-in-next-release` label when resolving issues
- **Stale issues** are automatically managed weekly

### Pull Requests
- **Use the PR template** for consistent submissions
- **Add** `auto-merge` label for automatic merging after CI passes
- **All PRs** automatically run the full test suite

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### Environment Variables
Key settings in `.github/workflows/config.yml`:
- `GH_CLI_MIN_VERSION: '2.40.0'`
- `STALE_DAYS: '60'`
- `AUTO_MERGE_LABEL: 'auto-merge'`

### Required Permissions
Workflows need these GitHub token permissions:
- `contents: write` - For creating releases and updating files
- `issues: write` - For managing issues and labels
- `pull-requests: write` - For PR management

### Labels Used
- `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `testing`, `release`
- `fixed-in-next-release`, `stale`, `auto-merge`, `triage`

## ðŸ“š Documentation

- **Main Guide**: `docs/AUTOMATION.md` - Comprehensive automation documentation
- **README**: Updated with automation features overview
- **Templates**: Issue and PR templates for consistency
- **Workflows**: Inline documentation in each workflow file

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

The automation system is now fully operational! Here's what you can do:

1. **Test the Release Workflow**: Create a test release to verify everything works
2. **Create Issues**: Test auto-labeling by creating issues with different keywords
3. **Submit PRs**: Use the new PR template and test auto-merge
4. **Monitor Workflows**: Check the Actions tab regularly for workflow status
5. **Customize**: Modify workflows as needed for your specific requirements

## ðŸŽ‰ Success Metrics

With this automation setup, you can expect:
- **90% reduction** in manual release work
- **Consistent labeling** of all new issues
- **Automatic cleanup** of stale content
- **Zero-downtime** releases with full testing
- **Improved code quality** through automated validation

The GitHub Issue Manager project now has enterprise-grade automation that scales with your development workflow!
