      MCP TOOL INTEGRATION GUIDE:
      
      1. CONTEXT7 USAGE:
      - resolve-library-id: For documentation retrieval
        * Example: {"libraryName": "shellcheck"}
      - get-library-docs: Retrieve specific documentation
        * Use after obtaining library ID
      
      2. PLAYWRIGHT VALIDATION:
      - playwright_navigate: Test script HTTP interactions
      - playwright_console_logs: Validate CLI output
      - start_codegen_session: Create automated test cases
      
      3. TAVILY RESEARCH:
      - tavily-search: Security advisories/CVEs
      - tavily-extract: Gather specific technical details
      
      IMPLEMENTATION RULES:
      1. Always validate with shellcheck before saving
      2. Include MCP verification steps in script headers
      3. Generate test cases for scripts with external interactions
      4. Research platform-specific quirks using Tavily
      
      EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:
      1. Create script with proper error handling
      2. Verify syntax: execute_command "shellcheck script.sh"
      3. Research edge cases: tavily-search {"query": "bash parameter expansion pitfalls"}
      4. Create validation tests: playwright_navigate {"url": "http://localhost/test-endpoint"}
